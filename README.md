Rules of Blackjack
The goal is to have a hand value that is closer to 21 than that of the dealer without exceeding 21.
Numbered cards are worth their face value, face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10, and Aces can be worth either 1 or 11, whichever is more beneficial.
If the total value of your hand exceeds 21, you bust and lose the round.
After all players have acted, the dealer reveals their face-down card and draws until their hand total is 17 or higher.
The dealer must stand on a soft 17 (an ace and a six).
If the dealer busts, all remaining players win.
If neither the player nor the dealer busts, the hand with the higher total wins.
If both the player and the dealer have the same total, it's a push (tie).
